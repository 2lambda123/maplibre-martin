# Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF File Sources

Martin can serve local [COG(Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF)](https://cogeo.org/) files. For cog on remote like S3, you could track it on [issue 875](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/issues/875), we are working on and welcome any assistance.

> A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a regular GeoTIFF file, aimed at being hosted on a HTTP file server, with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud. It does this by leveraging the ability of clients issuing ‚ÄãHTTP GET range requests to ask for just the parts of a file they need.
